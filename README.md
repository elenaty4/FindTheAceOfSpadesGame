# FindTheAceOfSpadesGame
<p>This project is the very first big project I made in Java GUI code. It is a made up card game and the rules are as follows:</p>
<p>Click on the facedown cards to reveal them. 
If a White Joker is shown, then the cards except the White Joker are shuffled and faced back down.
If a Black Joker is shown, the game will end with a bad fortune.
If the Ace of Spades is shown, you'll receive a tarot fortune. </p>
